	abstract = {Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) have been identified as key bio-markers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and decision making. SPW-R detection typically relies on hand-crafted feature extraction, and laborious manual curation is often required. In this multidisciplinary study, we propose a novel, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) method in the form of deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) layers that can learn features of SPW-R events from raw, labeled input data. The algorithm is trained using supervised learning on hand-curated data sets with SPW-R events. The input to the algorithm is the local field potential (LFP), the low- frequency part of extracellularly recorded electric potentials from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The output prediction can be interpreted as the time-varying probability of SPW-R events for the duration of the input. A simple thresholding applied to the output probabilities is found to identify times of events with high precision. The reference implementation of the algorithm, named {\textquoteright}RippleNet{\textquoteright}, is open source, freely available, and implemented using a common open-source framework for neural networks (tensorflow.keras) and can be easily incorporated into existing data analysis workflows for processing experimental data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

## Clone

These codes can be downloaded using git (www.git-scm.com):

    cd <Repositories> # whatever download destination
    git clone https://github.com/CINPLA/RippleNet
    cd RippleNet

Some binary files like `.h5` and `.pkl` may be tracked using Git LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com)

## dependencies

- `python>=3`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `ipympls`
- `matplotlib`
- `h5py`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `notebook`
- `jupyter`
- `tensorflow>=2.0`
- `tensorflow-gpu` (optional)

Dependencies can be installed in your existing Python environment using
the `requirements.txt` file and the `pip` utility:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To install an Anaconda Python (www.anaconda.com) environment with these dependencies, issue

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate ripplenet

This will not install `tensorflow-gpu` for hardware acceleration by default.
